# Minor League Baseball has been searching for new and innovative ways to increase attendance. As the search continues, teams are shifting to prioritize entertainment for their fans over the actual game. This has lead to implementing various themes for games, holding fireworks following a win, and creating weekly promotions such as taco tuesday. 

This project analyzed what factors influenced attendance the most for the Bluefield Blue Jays, affiliates to the Toronto Blue Jays. Using these results and demographic data for the surrounding area, conclusions were drawn on the many different ways the Blue Jays can improve attendance.
